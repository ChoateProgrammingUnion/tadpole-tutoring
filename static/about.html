        <p style="margin: 3%; margin-top: 0;">Empathy is the keystone of discovery. The Coronavirus has had an
            unprecedented effect upon the socioeconomic condition of nations across the globe. As the world economy
            falters and individuals struggle to stay healthy, the practice of social distancing has become a normality.
            This has resulted in a myriad of issues, notably a decrease in the quality of students’ education. Young
            people are not only missing out on key face to face time with their teachers, but, perhaps more importantly,
            they are missing out on interactions with other individuals their age-- experiences that most anyone will
            tell you are fundamental to stimulating the learning process and igniting an enthusiasm for their work. It
            is through working with other students that kids find meaning in what they do, consider new perspectives,
            and challenge themselves. As such, in a time where the educational pillar that is the student community is
            crumbling, we seek to be the friends, role models, and educators that not only further the knowledge of
            students, but provide valuable interaction in a way that only youth can.

        <p style="margin: 3%; margin-top: 0;">We’re a non-profit organization
            that’s committed to doing good. Succinctly put, we provide affordable and high-quality online tutoring to
            students everywhere in the world. Better than this, we make a pointed effort of donating all our profits to
            charity, helping those harmed by the Coronavirus and beyond. Our tutors are of the highest order, coming
            from reputable educational institutions, and helping people in a way that adults can’t. It is our great
            honor to do our part in this trying time.
